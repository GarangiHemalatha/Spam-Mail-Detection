# Spam mail detector using ML
This Model can detect any kind of spam mail. Here i use ML Algorithm.
**Key steps to Spam Mail Detection:**
**Email Filtering:** One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.

Natural Language Processing: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique that enables machines to understand and process human language. It plays a crucial role in spam detection, as it helps in extracting meaningful features from emails such as subject, body, and attachments.


Text Classification: Text classification is a supervised learning technique used for spam detection. It involves labelling emails as spam or non-spam based on their features, such as the presence of certain keywords, tone, or grammar.


Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of selecting relevant features from the email to classify it as spam or non-spam. It involves extracting features such as the sender's email address, the presence of certain words or phrases, and the length of the email.


Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a technique that involves training the model on labelled data to predict the labels of new, unlabeled data. It is widely used in spam detection for text classification tasks. 







Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a technique used to find hidden patterns in the data without the need for labelled data. It can be used for anomaly detection, clustering, and association rule mining.
